Knight's Tour

01/08/2017

Objective: Given a Knight on an M,N board (where M & N > 0), attempt to brute force a solution to navigate the knight to every space on the board in an open tour. An open tour is when the knight does not need to return to the same space. A closed tour would mean the knight returns back to the origin square.

Boards under 8x8 will be far easier for the program to brute force, as anything 8x8 and above begin to climb into 10^60 or higher amount of moves ranges.
